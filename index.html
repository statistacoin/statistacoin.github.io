          <p>Make Your Own Economy</p>
          
          <h3>What is Statista Coin?</h3>
          <p>Statista Coin is more an economic space than just a coin. In it, coin is a tool of economy, not its holy object. To achieve this, Statista Coin starts from the ability to govern and organize. The root of its governance is the question: What do you value?</p>
          <p>Based on this core question of economy (which has been mostly taken away from us) Statista Coin is builds upon offers and decisions upon them as the basis for issuing and distributing its coins. The principle of Statista Coin could be condensed into this statement: Economy where our expression guides value (and not the other way around).</p>
          <h3>How does it work?</h3>
          <p>Statista Coin uses <a href="https://aragon.org">Aragon</a>  as its basis. It expands on Aragon's tools of governance and economy. Particularly, we're developing the tools for an offer-based economy, and its possibilities in economic governance.</p>
          <h3>What is lies in its future?</h3>
          <p>Currently we have the initial infrastructure running. The next steps will be twofold:</p>
          <p><em>Technical development:</em> Development of easier usability, in addition to increased functionality. We will be enhancing the offer structures and possibilities of governance with both new tools and enhancements to existing ones.</p>
          <p><em>Social Growth:</em> Economy is inherently a social organization. We are developing these tools in connection with <a href="https://hausderstatistik.org/">Haus der Statistik</a> and <a href="https://www.kw-berlin.de/en/projects/statista/">Statista Project</a> (Berlin), to empower this growing community to decide upon its own economy. Social development means engaging this community and addressing its needs.</p>
          <p>But beyond Haus der Statistik, the infrastructure of Statista Coin is usable for any community or organization -- even if it's just taking its first steps, into the world. In short, the infrastructure can be used by you as well, whoever you are.</p>
          <h3>Do you want to take part in building new economy?</h3>
          <p>Whether you're interested in joining the operation of Statista, or creating an economy for your organization, let us know. Any questions, even &quot;simple&quot; ones, are welcome.</p>
